# Wrangling_HW_10
For this assignment you will make a Shiny app using American Community Survey data.

Please write a Shiny app with the following features:

* a choice of which state to plot
* a choice of plotting either median household income (B19013_001), median gross rent (B25064_001), or the ratio of median gross rent to median household income

* a plot of the chosen variable in the chosen state.

You can make the plot using choroplethr, ggplot with geom_sf, or leaflet (if you want to try leaflet take a look at https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/shiny.html). You can plot county or census tract data; if you use choroplethr I suggest sticking to county-level.

Finally, save your work in a Github repository. For your submission, please send the address so that I can clone your repository.
